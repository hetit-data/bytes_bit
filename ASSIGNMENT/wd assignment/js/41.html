Declaring methods directly in JavaScript objects, often referred to as "object literals," can have several drawbacks:

1. Inefficient Memory Usage
Every time an object is created, the method is also recreated and stored in memory. This can lead to increased memory
consumption, especially when many instances of the object are created.
2. Lack of Inheritance
Methods declared directly in objects do not benefit from JavaScript's prototypal inheritance. This makes it harder to
share common behavior across multiple objects without duplicating code.
3. No Access to this in Arrow Functions
If you declare methods using arrow functions within object literals, the this keyword does not refer to the object
itself but instead inherits the this value from the surrounding context. This can lead to unexpected behavior.
4. Difficulty in Testing and Reusability
Methods declared within objects are not easily reusable outside the context of that object. This can make unit testing
and code reuse more challenging.
5. Inconsistent Method Binding
Methods declared directly within an object may need explicit binding (using .bind(), for example) if passed as
callbacks. Otherwise, the context (this) might be lost.
6. Code Duplication
When using object literals, if you need the same method in multiple objects, you'll have to duplicate the method across
these objects, leading to redundancy and potential maintenance challenges.
